# Computer Graphics

Completion of eight exercises to master the fundamentals of digital image synthesis, producing rendered images and utilizing textures.

Developed a renderer in Java with the following features:

- **Stochastic ray tracing** for realistic image generation
- Scene graph setup including objects such as cuboids, cylinders, hyperboloids, spheres, and planes
- Materials supporting **diffuse, reflective, and transparent** properties with adjustable textures
- **Global illumination** via point and directional light sources, along with materials that emit light diffusely
- Applied **affine transformations** to both the camera and scene
- Performance enhancement through **bounding volume hierarchy** and **multithreading**

The implementation involved extensive use of the **composite design pattern** and recursion, alongside a deepened understanding of **linear algebra**.
